I am an ECE PhD candidate at Princeton University advised by [Prof. David Wentzlaff](https://princeton.edu/~wentzlaf), part of the [Princeton Parallel Group](https://parallel.princeton.edu). 

I am also part of the [DECADES Project](https://decades.cs.princeton.edu/).

I am interested in computer architecture research related to building chips: how can chip architectures be designed to be easier to realize on silicon and come time-to-market faster given a secretive semicondutor IP industry and vulnerable semiconductor manufacturing supply chains? I am also interested in the future trends of chip architecture where chip finanical costs and manufacturing times are reduced and (potentially) reach zero.

In collaborations, I've worked on heterogenous architectures, reconfigurable architectures, and open source chips.
